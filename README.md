# Villa of the Papyri (Book App)

Pronunciation (pah-pee-ree)

Papyri is an easy way to keep track of all your favorite books. Organize them in 'bookshelfs' depending on your Reading Status (Have Read, Reading Now, Read Later, etc.) and have your books filtered by genre within each Reading Status.

## Quick History
The Villa of the Papyri (scrolls) was an ancient Roman villa in Herculaneum known for its architecture and large amounts of art, sculptures, and scrolls. It was covered in ash when Mt. Vesuvius erupted in AD 79. It was later discovered around ~1750 and contained over 1,800 papyrus scrolls. It is the only surviving library from the Graeco-Roman world that exists in its entirety.

## Application
The purpose of this application is to store and keep track of your own personal library. If you want to amass a large library like that of the Villa of the Papyri, this will be a good place to organize and maintain your collection.

## Problem I am Solving
The problem is I have hundreds (or a thousand maybe) books and no way to organize and track them. I also have hundreds more on a saved shopping cart somewhere. I want to organize all my books by Reading Status (Have Read, Reading Now, Read Later, etc.) and then have those books organized by genre.

I could brute force this and create an excel spreadsheet and manually type in all the books, create categories, grab pictures, etc. and store it that way. That will be very inefficient.

Instead, I could create an app, use an API, and very quickly and efficiently have them organized in the way that makes sense. I can also store books I want to buy and continue to add to my library.
